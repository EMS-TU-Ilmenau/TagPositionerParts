# Tag positioner parts

This project features CAD models and "meshed" objects ready for 3D printing the parts of the [tag positioner](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8719272).

## Hints

- The CAD models (`.slvs`) can be edited with [solvespace](http://solvespace.com/index.pl). For 3D printing, use the `.stl` files. 
- The motor holder and spool are designed for NEMA17 motors. 
- The spool is assembled using M3 screws. 
- For attaching the tag, we advise to print and cut out the [template](tagholder/TagSheet.pdf) and fold the upper part twice by 1 cm as marked.
